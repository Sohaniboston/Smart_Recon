# High-Level Design (HLD) Generation Plan for SmartRecon 
 
**Objective:** To create a comprehensive High-Level Design (HLD) document for the SmartRecon project. This plan outlines the structure, content, and methodology for generating the HLD, ensuring it aligns with the project's Product Requirements Document (PRD) and overall vision. 
 
## 1. Foundational Documents Review 
 
I will start by thoroughly reviewing the following key documents to ensure the HLD is grounded in the project's requirements and context: 
 
-   **`SmartRecon_PRD_V03.md`**: The primary source for functional and non-functional requirements. 
-   **`00_Data_Recon_Project_Description_v1.md`**: For understanding the solution architecture, workflow, and technical context. 
-   **`Application_Workflow.md`**: To understand the application's flow and user interaction.
 
## 2. HLD Document Structure 
 
The HLD will be structured to mirror the PRD, providing a clear line of sight from requirements to design. Each section of the PRD will be expanded with technical and architectural details. 
 
**HLD Structure:** 
 
1.  **Introduction** 
    *   1.1. Purpose of the HLD 
    *   1.2. Scope of the System 
    *   1.3. Objectives and Goals 
    *   1.4. Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Definitions
 
2.  **System Architecture** 
    *   2.1. Architectural Overview (Monolithic, modular design) 
    *   2.2. System Context Diagram (Mermaid Diagram) 
    *   2.3. Component Diagram (Mermaid Diagram showing core modules) 
    *   2.4. Technology Stack (Python, Pandas, etc.)
 
3.  **Data Architecture** 
    *   3.1. Data Model (Key data entities: Transactions, Accounts, etc.) 
    *   3.2. Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Diagram) 
    *   3.3. Data Storage (CSV file structure, potential for future database) 
    *   3.4. Data Security and Privacy
 
4.  **Core Modules and Functionality (Detailed Design)** 
    *   4.1. **Data Ingestion Module**: Design for handling various data sources. 
    *   4.2. **Data Parsing and Standardization Module**: Transformation logic. 
    *   4.3. **Reconciliation Engine**: Core matching algorithms and rules. 
    *   4.4. **Exception Handling and Management Module**: Workflow for managing discrepancies. 
    *   4.5. **Reporting and Analytics Module**: Design for generating reports and dashboards. 
    *   4.6. **User Interface (UI/UX) Module**: High-level CLI design. 
    *   4.7. **Configuration Module**: How users can configure rules and settings. 
    *   4.8. **Logging and Auditing Module**: System for tracking and auditing. 
    *   4.9. **Security and Access Control Module**: (Placeholder for future development)
 
5.  **Integration and Interfaces** 
    *   5.1. API Design (if applicable) 
    *   5.2. Integration with External Systems (e.g., ERPs, Banks) 
 
6.  **Deployment and Operations** 
    *   6.1. Deployment Diagram (Mermaid Diagram) 
    *   6.2. System Requirements (Hardware, Software) 
    *   6.3. Maintenance and Support 
 
7.  **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** 
    *   7.1. Performance 
    *   7.2. Scalability 
    *   7.3. Reliability and Availability 
    *   7.4. Security 
 
8.  **Assumptions, Dependencies, and Risks**
 
## 3. Diagram Generation Plan 
 
I will use Mermaid syntax to create the following diagrams directly within the HLD markdown file: 
 
1.  **System Context Diagram**: To visualize the system's boundaries and interactions. 
2.  **Component Diagram**: To illustrate the relationships between the core modules. 
3.  **Data Flow Diagram**: To show how data moves through the system. 
4.  **Deployment Diagram**: To describe the runtime environment. 
 
For each diagram, I will: 
1.  Gather the necessary information from the source documents. 
2.  Write the Mermaid code. 
3.  Validate the code using the `mermaid_diagram_validator` tool. 
4.  Embed the validated code in the HLD.
 
## 4. Execution Strategy 
 
I will generate the HLD in a section-by-section manner to manage complexity and ensure accuracy. 
 
1.  **Initial Draft**: Create the main HLD file (`SmartRecon_HLD_v1.md`) with the complete structure outlined above. 
2.  **Iterative Content Population**: Populate each section of the HLD, starting with the System Architecture. 
3.  **Diagram Integration**: Create and embed the Mermaid diagrams as I progress through the relevant sections. 
4.  **Review and Refine**: After populating all sections, I will perform a final review to ensure consistency and completeness.
