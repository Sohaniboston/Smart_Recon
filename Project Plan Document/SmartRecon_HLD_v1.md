## 3. Data Architecture 
 
### 3.1. Data Model 
 
The core data entities in the SmartRecon system are: 
 
**Transaction:** Represents a single financial transaction from either the bank statement or the general ledger. 
*   `TransactionID` (string, unique) 
*   `Date` (datetime) 
*   `Amount` (float) 
*   `Description` (string) 
*   `Reference` (string) 
*   `Source` (string, e.g., 'Bank', 'GL') 
 
**ReconciliationMatch:** Represents a successful match between a bank transaction and a GL transaction. 
*   `MatchID` (string, unique) 
*   `BankTransactionID` (string) 
*   `GLTransactionID` (string) 
*   `MatchDate` (datetime) 
*   `MatchType` (string, e.g., 'Exact', 'Rule-based') 
 
**Exception:** Represents a transaction that could not be matched automatically. 
*   `ExceptionID` (string, unique) 
*   `TransactionID` (string) 
*   `Reason` (string, e.g., 'No Match Found', 'Multiple Matches') 
*   `Status` (string, e.g., 'Open', 'Resolved')
 
### 3.2. Data Flow Diagram 
 
```mermaid 
graph TD

    C[GL Data CSV] -- 
 
### 3.3. Data Storage 
 
For the initial version, all data will be stored in CSV files. 
 
*   **Input Data:** Bank and GL data will be provided as CSV files in a designated input directory. 
*   **Output Data:** Reconciliation results, exceptions, and reports will be saved as CSV files in a designated output directory. 
*   **Configuration:** Reconciliation rules and other settings will be stored in a YAML or JSON file. 
 
### 3.4. Data Security and Privacy 
 
As the application handles sensitive financial data, security is a key consideration. 
 
*   **Data at Rest:** The CSV files will be stored on the local file system. It is the user's responsibility to secure the environment where the application is run. 
*   **Data in Transit:** Not applicable for the initial CLI version. 
*   **Data Masking:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be masked or removed from the data before it is used by the application, if possible.
 
## 4. Core Modules and Functionality (Detailed Design) 
 
### 4.1. Data Ingestion Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Reads data from bank and GL CSV files. 
*   **Inputs:** File paths for the bank and GL data. 
*   **Outputs:** Pandas DataFrames containing the raw transaction data. 
*   **Error Handling:** Handles file not found errors, and invalid file formats. 
 
### 4.2. Data Parsing and Standardization Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Cleans, transforms, and standardizes the raw data into a consistent format. 
*   **Inputs:** Pandas DataFrames from the Data Ingestion Module. 
*   **Outputs:** Standardized Pandas DataFrames. 
*   **Transformations:** 
    *   Column mapping and renaming. 
    *   Data type conversion (e.g., string to datetime, string to float). 
    *   Handling missing values. 
    *   Applying basic data cleaning rules.
 
### 4.3. Reconciliation Engine 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** The core logic for matching transactions. 
*   **Inputs:** Standardized bank and GL DataFrames. 
*   **Outputs:** DataFrames of matched transactions and exceptions. 
*   **Matching Rules:** 
    *   **One-to-One:** Exact match on TransactionID, Date, and Amount. 
    *   **One-to-Many:** One transaction in one source matches multiple transactions in the other. 
    *   **Many-to-Many:** Multiple transactions in both sources match. 
    *   **Rule-based:** Fuzzy matching on description, reference, and date ranges. 
 
### 4.4. Exception Handling and Management Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Manages unmatched transactions. 
*   **Inputs:** DataFrame of exceptions. 
*   **Outputs:** Exception reports. 
*   **Functionality:** 
    *   Categorizes exceptions (e.g., no match, multiple matches). 
    *   Provides suggestions for manual matching. 
    *   Allows users to manually match or resolve exceptions (future feature).
 
### 4.5. Reporting and Analytics Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Generates reports and provides analytics on the reconciliation process. 
*   **Inputs:** DataFrames of matched transactions and exceptions. 
*   **Outputs:** CSV reports. 
*   **Reports:** 
    *   **Reconciliation Summary:** Summary of matched and unmatched transactions. 
    *   **Detailed Matched Transactions:** List of all matched transactions. 
    *   **Exception Report:** Detailed list of all exceptions. 
 
### 4.6. User Interface (UI/UX) Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the application. 
*   **Functionality:** 
    *   Accepts command-line arguments for input file paths, output directory, and configuration file. 
    *   Displays progress and status messages. 
    *   Prints a summary of the reconciliation results to the console.
 
### 4.7. Configuration Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Manages user-configurable settings. 
*   **Inputs:** Path to a configuration file (YAML or JSON). 
*   **Outputs:** A configuration object used by other modules. 
*   **Configurable Settings:** 
    *   Reconciliation rules (e.g., date tolerance, amount tolerance). 
    *   Column mappings for input files. 
    *   Logging level. 
 
### 4.8. Logging and Auditing Module 
 
*   **Responsibilities:** Logs application events and provides an audit trail. 
*   **Functionality:** 
    *   Logs events to a file and/or the console. 
    *   Configurable log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR). 
    *   Logs key events such as the start and end of the reconciliation process, the number of records processed, and any errors that occur.
 
## 5. Integration and Interfaces 
 
### 5.1. API Design 
 
Not applicable for the initial CLI version. A REST API may be considered for future versions. 
 
### 5.2. Integration with External Systems 
 
Integration with external systems will be done via CSV files. The application will not directly connect to any external systems.

The modular design will allow for future scalability. The application can be scaled vertically by running it on a more powerful machine. 
 
### 7.3. Reliability and Availability 
 
The application should be reliable and produce consistent results. It should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
