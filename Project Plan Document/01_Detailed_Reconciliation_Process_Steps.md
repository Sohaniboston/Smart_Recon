# Financial Data Reconciliation Tool Workflow

## Process Workflow Goal
Automate reconciliation of GL (General Ledger) entries from two sources (e.g., ERP export vs. bank statement).

## Detailed Reconciliation Process

### Step-by-Step Description
1. **Data Collection**
   - Extract GL entries from the ERP system (typically CSV/Excel format)
   - Obtain bank statements or secondary data source (typically CSV/Excel format)
   - Validate file formats and completeness

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Standardize date formats across both datasets
   - Normalize transaction descriptions/references
   - Convert currency formats to numeric values
   - Remove duplicate entries
   - Handle missing values appropriately

3. **Data Mapping**
   - Identify matching fields between sources (transaction date, amount, reference number)
   - Create uniform column names for comparison
   - Apply business rules for data categorization

4. **Reconciliation Process**
   - Match transactions based on key identifiers (amount, date, reference number)
   - Identify exact matches
   - Apply fuzzy matching for near-matches (e.g., slight differences in descriptions)
   - Flag unmatched items from both sources
   - Calculate variance between matched items

5. **Exception Handling**
   - Categorize exceptions (timing differences, missing entries, duplicates)
   - Investigate unmatched or variance items
   - Document explanations for reconciling items
   - Create adjustment entries where necessary

6. **Reporting**
   - Generate reconciliation summary (total matched, unmatched, with variances)
   - Detailed exception reports with suggested actions
   - Produce audit trail of all adjustments made
   - Create visualization of reconciliation results

7. **Documentation**
   - Save reconciliation state for future reference
   - Document explanations for exceptions
   - Export finalized reconciliation for approval

## Typical Tasks Performed by Financial Analysts

1. **Pre-Reconciliation**
   - Establish reconciliation frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Define matching criteria and tolerance levels
   - Set up data source connections
   - Establish business rules for categorizing transactions

2. **During Reconciliation**
   - Clean and standardize data manually
   - Match transactions line by line
   - Investigate discrepancies
   - Document explanations for variances
   - Create journal entries for adjustments
   - Escalate complex discrepancies

3. **Post-Reconciliation**
   - Review reconciliation summary
   - Obtain necessary approvals
   - Update accounting systems with adjustments
   - Archive reconciliation documentation
   - Identify recurring issues for process improvement
