I want to generate a High-Level Design (HLD) Document from te PRD  next.  Read the PRD and give me your detailed plan for generating the HLD from the PRD.   Make sure that you DO NOT EXCEED TOKEN LIMITS OR HIT A TOKEN LIMIT.  The HDL should mirror the PRD Table of Contents and include the considerations and requirements in both the PRD and the Project Description Document.  

Give me your understanding of this task and wait for me to confirm your understanding.  Are you clear? 


Remember : Always write out a new file and use Semantic Versioning file naming convention. If you are patching an incomplete file, then increment the PATCH or revision number. Are you clear what to do?
