2. Module Integration Gap 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
Problem: Exact and fuzzy matching engines not connected to main workflow
Impact: No end-to-end reconciliation capability
Evidence: Modules exist but workflow integration incomplete
3. Import Path Issues 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
Problem: Relative imports causing test failures
Impact: Unit tests not executable
Evidence: from ..utils.exceptions import MatchingEngineError errors

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
Focus on Environment First: Resolve Python path issues before code changes
Leverage Existing Assets: You have 95% of core functionality already built
Integration Over New Features: Connect existing modules rather than building new ones
Test-Driven Validation: Ensure each integration step works before proceeding
Bottom Line: SmartRecon is much closer to completion than the v4.0 roadmap indicated. The core functionality exists - it just needs proper environment setup and workflow integration to achieve full MVP status.
